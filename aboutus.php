          <p style="font-family: roboto;">At the end of 2019, A virus emerged from Wuhan, China. A virus that is so
            dangerous can be transferred through the air, and until this day, there is no
            cure for this viruses. People infected by this virus can cause pneumonia,
            acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, septic
            shock, and death. A virus that started in the most populous in Central China
            soon will cause a pandemic in the world.</p> 
            
            <p style="font-family: roboto;"> Fast forward to 2022. After several
              lockdowns and Movement Control Order (MCO) done by the Malaysian
              Government, Malaysia is now in the endemic phase. During MCO, Malaysian
              citizens are unable to cross-district, and businesses such as food and
              beverages and tourism are unable to open to avoid the spread of covid-19.
              This affected the income of those sectors, and some of them needed to fired
              some of their workers, so their businesses did not go bankrupt. Now in the
              year 2022, Malaysian citizens are allowed to go interstate, and a lot of
              companies start to open again, and this moment is used by businesses to
              recover back their losses during covid.</p>

              <p style="font-family: roboto;">Penang, one of Malaysia's famous
                tourism spots for domestic tourism, has reported an increase in domestic
                tourists after the Government lifted the cross-district ban. After being locked
                down for months, it is an excellent time to take a vacation to release some
                stress. Most tourists will visit Penang's famous food stalls and restaurants,
                leaving the small business only to get a small margin of profit. This project is
                held so that the small business could get exposure to the domestic tourists
                and help the small business to rebound back from their loss during MCO.</p>
